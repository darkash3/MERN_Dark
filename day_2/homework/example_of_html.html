        <h3>Basic HTML concepts</h3>
        <p>Toady we are going to learn about bacis HTML concepts. This includes all about tags used in HTML like head, body, h-tags for headings, meta tag used in head, clear screen, break and paragraph tags.</p>
        <h3>1. Head Tag</h3>
        <p>Head tag gives us the basic information about the web page that we are creating. In this we include meta tag, title tag and so on..... Although this head is used very less while coding, it is the most important tag used. The title tag used in this head tag allows us to give our own title to website which we are creating. And remaining code is written in body part.</p>
        <h3>Meta Tag</h3>
        <p>Meta tag gives us the basic information about the website. The Meta tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. Meta tags always go inside the head element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.            
            Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable. Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services.

        <h3>2. Body Tag</h3>
        <p>The body tag defines the document's body. The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. Note: There can only be one body element in an HTML document.
